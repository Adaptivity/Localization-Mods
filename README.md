Localization-Mods
=================

Localization repository for my Minecraft Mods which sources are not already hosted on GitHub.

Q: How do I make localization files?
A: Check out a quick guide by XCompWiz here: https://twitter.com/XCompWiz/status/485048319253958656

Q: When will my localization PR be pulled?
A: They will be pulled when I get the chance/remember to look at this repo's PRs (hopefully not too long). However, they'll only be in the next release of the mod when I remember to include them as IMO localizations aren't largely important if the en_US ones exist.
